Bee4lan application is intended as a tool for network administrators, who 
manage LANs with client computers running Windows. 
An pplication needs only Python, samba network share and a computer.  This 
computer could be a server running Linux (best option), a client windows machine, or 
adminâ€™s own computer at home. 

Bee4lan management system is based on Python 2.7.11 and its extension pywin32.
Use
	python-2.7.11.msi
	pywin32-220.win32-py2.7.exe
if you want have the original environment.
All this stuff you can find at this installation CD. 

Any comments are welcome!


Bee4lan installation to SERVER:
---------------------------------
- simply copy bee4lan folder to your fileserver.

---------------------------------
- IMPORTANT!!! Set correct paths especially in these files on server:
    
    bee4lan\install\bee4lan_svc.py
    bee4lan\core.py
    setup_svc.bat

- Now go to your client computer. Manually connect your intended server share, open 
administrators command prompt, services.msc and eventvwr.
